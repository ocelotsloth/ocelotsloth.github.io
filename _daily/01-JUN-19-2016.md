Welcome to my experiment! I'm going to be creating an image a day for the next year just to see what happens. I think that it will prove to be good experience and help me grow as a photographer. Be sure to keep following!

For this first image, I wanted to experiment with tilt shift photography. Since I don't have a tilt shift lens, I had to do it in post. This is a picture that I took a couple of months ago, but am revisiting because it was a good candidate for this style of editing.

The photo was taken from a high angle and blurred selectively to give it the same shallow depth of field effect that macro photography has. This makes everything in the image look much smaller than it is in reality. It's a neat effect and I think that I'm going to be playing with it a lot more in the future. I'm sure that it could be done better but I'm going to have plenty of time to experiment with the technique over the next year if I want to.
