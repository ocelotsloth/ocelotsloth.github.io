Because of the high levels of humidity in the greenhouse when I took this picture,
my lens was pretty badly fogged up (something I didn't realize till a few minutes
after I took this picture). Turns out that Lightroom has a feature that works
really well for helping to mitigate this particular problem, and it's the Dehaze
tool. Just thought this was interesting so I shared.
