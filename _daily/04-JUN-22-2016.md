As part of my internship with NASA LaRC this summer, I was able to go and view the
research hanger used to store the aircraft used around the world by NASA Langley
Research Center. In this picture, you can see the fully analog flight simulator
used in the Mercury and Gemini missions to simulate all six degrees of motion. This
system is considered a US National Historic Landmark, and was the first of its kind.
