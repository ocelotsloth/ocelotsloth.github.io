I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering at George Mason University. In my
free time I work on projects with [SRCT](https://srct.gmu.edu), a student
organization which aims to create tools to help the community at Mason.

I also make things. Sometimes the things I make turn out to be neat, but mostly
they just interest me in some form or fashion, so I put them here. Be sure to
check them out and comment if you think it's interesting!

In addition I am a part of George Mason's amazing Green Machine Pep Band, which
was named the NCAA's number one pep band! There I split my time between sound
engineering and troubleshooting equipment problems.

If you like what I'm doing you can follow me here, on

me an email at mark at stengle dot in.
