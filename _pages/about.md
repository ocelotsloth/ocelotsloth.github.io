I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at George Mason University. In my
free time I work on projects with [SRCT](https://srct.gmu.edu), a student
organization which aims to create tools to help the communityat Mason.

I also make things. Sometimes the things I make turn out to be neat, but mostly
they just interest me in some form or fashion, so I put them here. Be sure to
check them out and comment if you think it's interesting!

In addition I am a part of George Mason's amazing Green Machine Pep Band, which
was named the NCAA's number one pep band! There I split my time between sound
engineering and troubleshooting equipment problems.

If you like what I'm doing you can follow me here, on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mark_stenglein), and my
[GitHub repositories](https://github.com/ocelotsloth). Also, feel free to send
me an email at mark at stengle dot in.
